The header files in this directory exist for the following reasons:

fifonode.h              The source of this file in /usr/include/sys/fs
			has a syntax error in the pre-processor
			#if test at line 35.  This private copy
			corrects the syntax error.

memfs_mnode.h           The mnode structure defined by the source
			of this file in /usr/include/sys/fs is
			missing 8 bytes before the mno_vnode member.
			This private copy supplies two dummy integer
			members in compensation.

namenode.h              The source of this file in /usr/include/sys/fs
			has a syntax error in the pre-processor
			#if test at line 46.  This private copy
			corrects the syntax error.
